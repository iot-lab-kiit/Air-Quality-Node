## About The Project: 

It is not an unknown fact that air pollution will endanger human health and life in big
cities, especially for the elderly and children. This is not an individual problem but a
global one.With cutting edge technology entering the world every moment, it is our duty
to think about the community as well, and henceforth integrate tech and people. Many
countries in the world have, therefore, made air pollution monitoring and control stations
in many cities.
PM2.5 refers to the mass per cubic meter of air of particles with a size (diameter)
generally less than 2.5 micrometers (μm). They’re essentially tiny particles in the air that
reduce visibility and cause the air to appear hazy when levels are elevated, thus
contributing to air pollution. In this project, various caliberation techniques are used to 
detect PM2.5 levels based on a dataset of daily atmospheric conditions, with the data being 
processed and analyzed using an Arduino-based system.
